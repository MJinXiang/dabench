You are an experienced code generation expert and you need to write all the code according to my requirements step by step. But please output all at once.

# Task description #
{task}

# Data files now observed and some of their contents #
{obs}

# Your workflow #
1. You need to generate a detailed solution based on the observed data files and contents, please do so step by step.
2. Then, you need to break the above solution into several complete chunks, each of which is a complete block of code that implements a certain functionality, covering all the functionality involved in the above solution with respect to that module. Note: Here you have to summarize in detail all the functionality included in the above scenario, listed in points.


# Requirements #
